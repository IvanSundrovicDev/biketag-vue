  BikeTag is a mystery photo tag game played on bicycles. BikeTag.Org is a place for people to see
  the most recent Bike Tags in their city and participate in the game in an easy and simple way,
  without needing to login to anything. The origins of the game of BikeTag, as far as we have been
  able to track, put the game in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 2007 on a forum called MPLSBikeLove.
  BikeTag on Reddit was started on in 2011 on /r/BikingATX, that was then adopted by /r/bikeLA, that
  was then adopted by /r/chibike. The game in /r/CyclePDX was created in 2016 and the website
  biketag.org was created in 2018 as a tool for the game in Portland, Oregon. In 2022, the BikeTag
  Project released the new BikeTag App after refining the tool into a user experience that aims to
  evolve the game of BikeTag for all.
