  The BikeTag Project was started in 2018 as a way to make playing the game of BikeTag easy for
  anyone and everyone to play the game of BikeTag. Since then, our codebase and server
  infrastructure has grown considerably, in ways that allowed us to scale to offer tens of games all
  over the world. With the onset of BikeTag 2.0 (the software projects that run BikeTag games), we
  have sought to offer even more. This App was built to be the last free solution we provide to the
  communities playing BikeTag while allowing us to open up the opportunity for premium features to
  be developed on a subscription based platform. We hope you will consider becoming a subscriber.
